# Daily Planner

For this project, I have created a [daily planner](https://mattglwilliams.github.io/daily-planner/) that allows a user to plan in tasks for each hour of a standard working day (9am - 5pm). You can see an example of how it looks below:

I used:
- bootstrap to create and style the elements on the page.
- moment.js to get and display the current date in the header.
- jQuery and JavaScript to change the colour of the inputs depending on the time of day.
- jQuery and JavaScript to save the input in local storage when a user clicks the save button and to display it again on page load.
